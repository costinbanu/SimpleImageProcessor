# SimpleImageProcessor
Straightforward license plate bluring and image resizing tool.

The license plate detecting logic is provided by [openAlpr](https://www.openalpr.com/) (repo at https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr).

The bluring logic is based off of https://gist.github.com/superic/8165746.

The interface is in Romanian. Take contact for translations, though it is mostly disclaimers and a few instructions that are straight-forward :)
